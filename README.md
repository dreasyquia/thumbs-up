# ThumbsUp

## Project Description
ThumbsUp is a computer vision controlled photo booth program. Making a thumbs-up gesture in the camera will trigger a three second countdown followed by a photo capture. All photos are saved in the `photos` directory.

## How to Install and Run It
Install the cvzone and mediapipe packages.

## Credits
ThumbsUp makes use of CVZone's hand tracking module which can be found [here](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone.git). In creating this project, the ["Rock Paper Scissor using Computer Vision"](https://youtu.be/k2EahPgl0ho) tutorial of [Murtaza's Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/@murtazasworkshop) on YouTube was followed.
